Geometric Perception → State → Computation Pipeline (V-KERNEL)

---

1. Overview

This document defines a reproducible pipeline that maps:

geometric field → projections → state → interaction → convergence → computation

The system does not begin with instructions.
It begins with structured perception of a canonical field.

---

2. Canonical Field (Base Lattice)

Definition

A fixed geometric lattice:

- 19 nodes (central + rings)
- hexagonal / flower topology
- symmetric adjacency structure

Formal Representation

G = (V, E)

|V| = 19
E = adjacency defined by geometric proximity

Each node:

v_i = (x_i, y_i, optional z_i)

---

3. Mode Basis (Local Patterns)

The system operates not on raw geometry, but on local modes.

Definition

A mode is a spatial distribution over nodes:

m_k : V → ℝ

Examples:

- radial distribution
- ring distribution
- clustered nodes
- interference shapes

Interpretation

Modes form a basis of observable patterns:

M = {m_1, m_2, ..., m_n}

---

4. Projection Operators (Fractal Lenses)

Three independent projections extract different information from the same field.

---

4.1 Radial Operator

Captures flow and gradients.

P_radial(G) → F_radial

Detects:

- direction vectors
- gradients
- divergence / convergence

---

4.2 Ring Operator

Captures periodicity and stability.

P_ring(G) → F_ring

Detects:

- cycles
- symmetry
- resonance

---

4.3 Node Operator

Captures discrete structure.

P_node(G) → F_node

Detects:

- peaks
- connections
- clusters

---

5. Unified State Encoding

All projections are mapped into a shared state space.

State Vector

S ∈ ℝ^6

S = [red_mass,
     orange_flow,
     yellow_structure,
     green_balance,
     blue_law,
     violet_future]

Mapping

S = f(F_radial, F_ring, F_node)

Each component represents:

- mass → density
- flow → gradient
- structure → topology
- balance → symmetry
- law → constraints
- future → projection potential

---

6. Interaction (Field Evolution)

State evolves through local interactions.

Update Rule

S(t+1) = S(t) + Δ(S, neighbors)

Where:

Δ = interaction function

Includes:

- local mixing
- resonance amplification
- conflict damping

---

7. Metrics (Coherence Evaluation)

System stability is evaluated using scalar metrics.

---

7.1 Shadow (Variance)

shadow = variance(S)

Measures inconsistency.

---

7.2 Coherence

coherence = alignment(S)

Measures agreement across projections.

---

7.3 Target Fit

target_fit = similarity(S, target)

Optional convergence target.

---

7.4 Vitality

vitality = magnitude(ΔS)

Measures system activity.

---

8. Convergence Condition

System reaches convergence when:

coherence → max
shadow → min
ΔS → 0

---

9. Bindu State (Stable Attractor)

At convergence:

S* = stable fixed point

This state is:

- invariant under projection
- minimal energy configuration
- coherent across all lenses

---

10. Computation Interpretation

Computation is defined as:

input field → projection → interaction → convergence → output state

There are no explicit instructions.

Result emerges as:

stable geometric configuration

---

11. Implementation Path

To reproduce:

1. Define lattice (19 nodes)
2. Implement projection operators
3. Define mode basis
4. Encode unified state (ℝ^6)
5. Implement interaction rule
6. Track metrics
7. detect convergence

---

12. Key Principle

Computation = convergence of multiple projections over a shared field

---

13. Minimal Summary

field → views → state → interaction → stability → result
